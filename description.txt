Longbows FTW is a small mod that does two things:
 -It adds Longbows made from Hardmode ores (including Chlorophyte and Hallowed). They are non-Mechanical equivalents to Repeaters.
 -It makes Repeaters shoot slower, but with more damage, velocity and knockback. This way there is more variety for arrow-shooting weapons.
I hope you enjoy it!
